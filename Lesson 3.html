    <h2> What is HTML </h2>
      <ol>
        <li> The heart of the web </li>
        <li> Made of text content (what you see) </li>
        <li> References to other documents (images and video)</li>
        <li> Links to other pages </li>
      </ol>
    <div class='sub'>
      <b> What is HTML Markup? </b>
        <ul>
          <li> Made up of: </li>
            <ol>
              <li> Tags: <name> Contents </name> </li>
              <li> First tage is the opening tag </li>
              <li> The whole thing is called an element </li>
            </ol>
            <li> First tag is the b tag for making text bold. It starts with a b and ends with a b </li>
            <li> The next tag is the em tag for making words italic; ends with the em tag and so forth </li>
          </ul>
    <b> Computers are Stupid </b>
    <ul>
      <li> This refers to how computers understand the instructions that human programmers have to give them </li>
      <li> In spoken language, sentences often have a great deal of ambiguity. For example, in the sentence "Each of us saw her duck", does that mean we all saw her pet duck, or did we see her duck under something. Depending on the context, either could be correct </li>
      <li> Computers can't make such inferences and only interpret language literally. Computer programming languages are designed to limit ambiguity, but sometimes this can result in issues between the programmer and the machine </li>
      <li> They are thus very sensitive to typos and errors:
        <ol>
          <li> What happens when we forget to add a closing em tag: Everything after the opening tag is italicised </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2> HTML Attributes </h2>
  img - images
  <ul>
    <li> An example is:
      <ul>
        <li> img src=url alt=text </li>
        <ul>
          <li> Src (source) is the attribute, the URL to download from </li>
          <li> The other attribute is alt, meaning alternet. It's what is displayed when the image can't load for whatever reason. It's required in the sense that HTML parses will complain if it's not there. It's used for broken requests </li>
        </ul>
        <li> Img tags don't have closing tags, as there's no content. They're void tags </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <div class='sub'>
    <b> It's OK to Forget </b>
    <ul>
      <li> Why is it that anchor tags use the href tag as an attribute whilst img tags use src? Remember, if you use one attribute in place of the other, your html won't work </li>
      <li> It's okay to forget what to use where; that's what Google is for. Programming is about understanding the bigger concepts. Unless you write HTML regularly, you're bound to forget something soon. There are simply too  many facts to remember them all </li>
      <li> As suggested, Google is a good source for help. Also look at the website for W3Schools. Also check out MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) </li>
      <li> The bottom line: Use documentation </li>
    </ul>
    <b> Whitespace </b>
    <ul>
      <li> Remember, that when text is input into HTML on multiple lines, it renders them on a single line </li>
      <li> You can use the br tag to break one line into multiple lines. Br doesn't need a closing tag; it's another void tag </li>
    </ul>
    <b> Paragraph Tag </b>
    <ul>
      <li> Another way to break spae is by the p tag (paragraph). The <p> tag does need a closing tag. It will render a line as one paragraph. With the p tag, there is an extra bit of space between the lines that doesn't occur when using the br tag </li>
      </ul>
      <b> Inline vs Block Elements </b>
      <br> <img src='images/inline-block.png' alt='image of HTML code' height=20% width=30% />
      <ul>
        <li> Take the sentence: "This text is really too long one line" </li>
        <li> If we format it as:
          <ul>
            <li> "This text &nbsp; &nbsp; is br really    0  &nbsp;  too   &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  long &nbsp; one &nbsp; line" </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> It will always be rendered as:
          <ul>
            <li> This text is </li>
            <li> Really too long one line </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Regardless of the white space. Why is this? Why do we have two ways of making new lines? The br tag simply ends a line, so if we put it in between words, whatever is beyond the br tag simply wraps to the next line </li>
        <li> The p tag works differently: It makes an invisible box around the text, which can have height and width attributes </li>
        <li> Other inline elements include em and img </li>
      </ul>
      <b> Span and Div Elements </b>
      <ul>
        <li> Normal elements; both have content </li>
        <li> Span is inline; Div is block
        <br> <img src='images/span-div.png' alt='image of HTML code' height=20% width=30% /> </li>
        <li> Take Span as an example:
          <ul>
            <li> &lt;span&gt; This is one line &lt;span&gt; <br> Yep, one line </br> </li>
          </ul>
        <li> If we change it to:
          <ul>
            <li> &lt;div&gt; This is one line &lt;div&gt; <br> Yep, one line </br> </li>
          </ul>
        <li> It behaves more like the &lt;p&gt; tag; the div creates a box around "This is one line" </li>
        <li> Which elements are 'inline':
          <ul>
            <li> &lt;a&gt; </li>
            <li> &lt;span&gt; </li>
            <li> &lt;br&gt; (seems confusing, as it shigts words to a new line, but it doesn't behave like true block elements, in that it doesn't add height or width to anything, it simply shifts lines) </li>
            <li> &lt;img &gt; (which is both inline and block) </li>
            <li> &lt;strong&gt; </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

      <h2> Document Structure </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Here is the basic structure of an HTML document:
          <br> &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt; -doctype
          <br> &lt;html&gt;
          <br> &lt;head&gt;
          <br> &lt;/head&gt;
          <br> &lt;body&gt;
          <bt> &lt;b&gt; content &lt;/b&gt;
          <bt> &lt;/body&gt;
          <bt> &lt;/html&gt;
          <ul>
            <li> &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;: The attribute of 'html' used to be a lote more convoluted; this is not the case for HTML5, which just as the string 'html' </li>
            <li> &lt;html&gt;: The opening html tag, surrounding the rest of the document </li>
            <li> &lt;head&gt;: This tag contains meta-data and other things. If you're using CSS or Javascript, it goes in this tag </li>
            <li> &lt;title&gt;: The title of the tag, as it would appear at the top of a browser window </li>
            <li> &lt;body&gt;: Contains the contents of the documents. We've been working with contents of the body tag so far </li>
          </ul>
          <li> Another perspective on HTML documents:
            <ul>
              <li> html
                <br> &lt;head&gt;
                <br> Title, CSS, JSS
                <br> &lt;/head&gt;
                <br> &lt;body&gt;
                <br> Contents
                <br> &lt;/body&gt;
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class= 'sub'>
            <b> More on Document Structure </b>
              <ul>
                <li> The concept of code structure will come up frequently. This is because programmers write code not just for computers, but for people as well. Writing code that people can read easily is a VERY important idea in computer programming, and a huge part of writing good code is structuring it well </li>
                <li> If you’ve ever written an essay, you’re familiar with the purpose of indenting each paragraph. It’s a visual marker that a new idea has begun. It serves a similar purpose in writing code. Some languages have slightly different rules about proper indentation, but the concept is generally the same as in English - a new indent is a new idea </li>
                <li> One big difference between indenting programming languages and indenting English, however, is that an indentation level persists throughout the idea. In HTML particularly, the indentation level INCREASES when an idea begins and DECREASES when an idea is finished. Take the below for example:
                <br> <img src='images/example-doc-structure-ipnd.png' alt='image of HTML code' height=20% width=30% />
                </li>
                <li> Let's dissect what this code is about: </li>
                <ul>
                  <li> The first line is something that needs to appear on every webpage you make. <!DOCTYPE html> defines the type of the document so the browser will render it correctly </li>
                  <li> The &lt;html&gt; tag opens our document. Everything that shows on the web page is within this tag </li>
                  <li> The &lt;head&gt; tag contains metadata for our page. This includes the title of the page (what appears at the top of the browser). Notice that the &lt;head&gt; tag is indented to a new level, because the &lt;html&gt; tag was opened but not closed (so a new idea was started but not completed). Moreso, the &lt;title&gt; tag is indented another level further (because the &lt;head&gt; tag was opened but not closes </li>
                  <li> The &lt;title&gt; tag is closed on the same line it was opened, which we usually do if the content of the tag is short. On the other hand, the &lt;head&gt; tag is closed on a different line. The closing tag is indented to the same level as the matching opening one </li>
                  <li> Now, take a look at the contents of the &lt;body&gt; tag. Is there anything about the structure that is surprising> Notice that inside the &lt;body&gt; tags you have the content of the web page. You can see an &lt;h1&gt; tag that is idented just inside the body as well as a &lt;p&gt; tag that is on the same level of indentation as the &lt;h1&gt;. This is an important distinction. Both the head and paragraph are child elements of the body </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>

              <h2> Summary </h2>
              <ul>
                <li> The web is largely comprised of HTML documents (hypertext markup language). HTML is the language browsers use to interpret web pages. The components of the web include the client (your PC and browser), the Internet and servers. The client and server interact via http (hypertext transfer protocol) </li>
                <li> HTML elements are what we use to tell a browser how to display content on pages. Most HTML elements consist of an opening and closing tag with come content in between </li>
                <li> Some elements accept additional values called attributes in their opening tags. These provide additional info to the browser. For example, the anchor takes an attribute called href and defines a URL to link to </li>
                <li> Other HTML elements include: </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li> &lt;p&gt;: Defines a paragraph. The content of the &lt;p&gt; tag is in a 'box' </li>
                    <li> &lt;bt&gt;: Creates a line </li>
                    <li> &lt;div&gt;: Creats a 'box' container element </li>
                    <li> &lt;span&gt;: Creates an 'inline' container element </li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              </div>
    </body>
    </html>
